The Application mines all asteroids that are suitable for any three-body resonance of Jupiter and Saturn. It put this numbers to files grouped by resonance.

File stores integers can be generated by this [application](https://github.com/smirik/Three-body-resonances). This file has format like this:
```
1 -7 1 0 0 5 3.4910
1 -6 1 0 0 4 4.1247
1 1 -1 0 0 -1 4.1509
1 1 1 0 0 -3 4.1509
1 1 2 0 0 -4 4.1509
1 1 3 0 0 -5 4.1509
1 1 4 0 0 -6 4.1509
1 2 -1 0 0 -2 3.5083
1 2 1 0 0 -4 3.5083
1 2 2 0 0 -5 3.5083
```
First 6 numbers is integers satisfying D'Alambert rule and last value is semimajor axis of resonance.

The Application returns librated asteroids by data from database. Options of database connection are pointed by CLI options.
Database for this application available in that [container](https://hub.docker.com/r/4xxi/resonances-data/).
